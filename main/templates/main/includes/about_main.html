<p><span class="first-character">I</span>n 2015 we first walked the halls of St Johns ward for peadiatric cancer and
    became part of that small group of families who know what it is to try to deal with a childhood cancer diagnosis. We
    will never forget the bravery of the many children we met on those corridors. We will also remember the health care
    professionals that looked after Molly and done thier best to help her beat this insidious horrific disease</p>
<p>We created this site with the aim to drive awareness of childhood cancer as before out journey we were ignorant to
    the world of peadiatric cancer.</p>
<p>This is our way of giving back a little bit and trying to preserve the memory of our beautiful much loved daughter.
    This is Molly Roses legacy.</p>
